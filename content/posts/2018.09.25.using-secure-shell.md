SSH (or Secure Shell) is a protocol that is used to securely access other computer terminals, over insecure network. Using SSH, we can remote login in other computers and perform command shell operations on it. All communication is encrypted using strong encryption algorithms.

Below diagram illustrates the basic working mechanism of SSH which uses public-private key cryptography to secure the communicating channel. SSH is the client program while SSHD is the server which is essentially an Open SSH Daemon that must be running on remote computer that we intend to login to.

### My Environment

I’m running Windows 10 that has recently added native OpenSSH implementations. See [this article](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/openssh-in-windows-10/) to enable the feature. However, if you are on UNIX or LINUX then OpenSSH comes pre-installed. Run the following command to check whether “sshd” is running or not.

```bash
service ssh status
```

I’ve installed Windows Subsystem for Linux and running Linux Ubuntu on that. I will SSH in to Linux from windows command shell for demonstration purposes.

#### Troubleshoot WSL

If SSH is not running on WSL as it was not in my case. I had to run following commands to get it fixed

```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config # Change Port from 22 to 2222 (Since MS-Windows is using port 22)
sudo service ssh --full-restart
```

### Authentication

#### Using Password

The typical way to get remote access is through password. Just type

```bash
ssh saad@192.168.100.2
```

where saad is the user account name and IP address is the remote system’s IP. When prompted for password, enter your remote systems’s password and you are in.

However, if we are to SSH quite often, we do not want to enter passwords repeatedly, right? So there is another way, using Public/Private keys to configure the security once. After that you will not be asked to enter any credentials while accessing that remote computer/server.

#### Using Public/Private Key Pair

Execute the SSH keygen by using the following command.

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Press enter and provide any passphrase if you want to. It will then generate two files “id_rsa” and “id_rsa.pub” in .ssh folder inside your home directory.

Next, execute the following command on client computer

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh saad@192.168.100.2 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

It will add public key of client computer to the a file called “authorized_keys” inside .ssh folder on host computer. Please adjust paths, name and IP address according to your environment. That’s it, you will now be able to SSH without password.

Peace!
