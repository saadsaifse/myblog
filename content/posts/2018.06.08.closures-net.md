Normally when we create instance of an object, if we pass any value type variable without the `ref` keyword, a copy of that variable is passed to that object. And a copy of the reference in case of reference type variables. For example, in the below code snippet `score` is a value type variable and is passed by value to the constructor of Basket Counter class.

```csharp
int score = 0;

var bc = new BasketCounter(score); // score is passed by value

bc.Basket(); //increments basket counter's score by 1

score = 5; //obviously has no effect on Basket counter's local score variable

bc.Basket();
```

However, when we pass value types (or reference types) variables to a Lambda Expressions or Anonymous functions, the C# compiler creates what is called closure which can be thought of as an object but with the original context saved inside of it. All variables that are provided during the creation of closure are saved in a complier generated class. This process is called capturing the variables.

Consider below code snippet.

```csharp
int score = 0;

//creating closure by using Lambda expressions and an Anonymous function

//the "score" variable is captured by the closure.

Action Basket = () =>
{
score++;
Console.WriteLine($"Score is: {score}");
};

Basket(); //increments score by 1
Basket();

score = 5; //updates the score in closure as well

Basket(); //increments to 6
Basket();
```

The score variable is captured with the closure and contains the actual reference. If we update the value of score either from within anonymous method or outside of that, the change will be visible at both locations, as the reference of the same variable is passed between the two.
