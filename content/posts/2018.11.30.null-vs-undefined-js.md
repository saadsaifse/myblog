Coming from the `C#` world where every un-initialized type is `null`, difference between JavaScript's `null` and `undefined` seemed confusing to me. So I did some testing using below code:

```javascript
let someVariable

let anotherVariable = null

let undefinedVariable = undefined

console.log(someVariable) //prints undefined

console.log(anotherVariable) //prints null

console.log(undefinedVariable) //prints undefined

if (someVariable == null)
  //true

  console.log("someVariable is loosely null")

if (someVariable === null)
  //false

  console.log("someVariable is strictly null")

if (someVariable === undefined)
  //true

  console.log("someVariable is strictly undefined")

if (null == undefined)
  //true

  console.log("null is equal to undefined")

console.log(typeof null) //object

console.log(typeof undefined) //undefined

if (!undefined) console.log("undefined is a falsy type")

if (!null) console.log("null is a falsy type")
```

### Takeaways

1. If a variable is defined but not initialized or assigned any value, its value will be `undefined`
1. A variable will only be `null`, if it is assigned a `null` value
1. `null` and `undefined` are loosely equal but are strictly unequal
1. Type of `undefined` is `undefined` which proved that `undefined` is a primitive type in JavaScript
1. The fact that `null` shows type as `object` despite being a primitive type is considered as a design mistake since initial stages of JavaScript
1. `null` and `undefined` are both falsy values

Another interesting difference is that default values in function arguments work in case of undefined variables but not if null is passed, as can be seen in below code snippet.

```javascript
var print = function(value = "hello world") {
  console.log(value)
}

print() //prints default value

print(undefined) //prints default value

print(null) //prints null
```
