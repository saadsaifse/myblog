To Install/uninstall an application from .MSI package in multiple domain computers, we usually create GPO through Group Policy Management. However, it only uninstalls the program which is installed by using Group Policy Management. I came across a situation where my development team installed an application manually on 43 computers. So I had to find a way to uninstall all of them as efficiently as possible. You can follow pretty straightforward guide below to get it done.

1. Login to any Domain computer using Domain Administrator account.
1. Press Windows key and search for WMIC. Right click on it and select “Run as Administrator”
1. If you do not know the exact name of program then enter the following query:
   ```cmd
   /node:”COMPUTER NAME” product get name,version,vendor
   ```
1. Note down the name of application that you want to uninstall
1. Now create a text file and write down names of all computers in quotes such that a new name is entered on new line. I called the file `DomainComputerNames.txt`. Sample content of the file are:

   ```
   "COMPUTER-1 NAME"
   "COMPUTER-2 NAME"
   "COMPUTER-3 NAME"
   ```

1. Open WMIC console again and type

   ```cmd
   /failfast:on /node:@”c:\DomainComputerNames.txt” product where name=”PRODUCT NAME” call uninstall /nointeractive
   ```

And that’s it. The specified application will be uninstalled from all computers.
