**How do you check if the value of an integral type is exceeding the maximum allowed value for the specified type?**

This question lead me to `checked` and `unchecked` keywords of C# language. Lets find out the default behaviors.

Checked keyword is used to enable explicit checking of overflow during arithmetic operations. While unchecked does the opposite.

For context, Integral types only include:

- integers
- char
- boolean
- byte
- short
- long

Lets try some code

#### Constant Values

In case of constants, C# compiler is able to tell if the outcome is exceeding the maximum value and issues a compile time error, so the situation of runtime exception does not even occur. However, if we are inside unchecked block, compiler does not raise any error or runtime exception and evaluates to incorrect outcome.

```csharp
int i1 = 2147483647 + 10; //compile time overflow error
Console.WriteLine(i1);
```

```csharp
checked
{
int i2 = 2147483647 + 10; //compile time overflow error
Console.WriteLine(i2);
}
```

```csharp
unchecked
{
int i3 = 2147483647 + 10; //no compile time error and no runtime overflow exception
Console.WriteLine(i3); //prints -2147483639
}
```

#### Variables

If there are one or more variable involved, then the behavior is little different. There is no compile time error as the variables are assigned values on runtime, so only runtime exception is thrown, that too only if we are inside checked block.

```csharp
int inc = 10;
int i1 = 2147483647 + inc; //no compile time overflow error and no runtime overflow exception
Console.WriteLine(i1);
```

```csharp

checked
{
int i2 = 2147483647 + inc; //no compile time overflow error but a runtime overflow exception
Console.WriteLine(i2);
}
```

```csharp
unchecked
{
int i3 = 2147483647 + inc; //no compile time overflow error and no runtime overflow exception
Console.WriteLine(i3);
}
```
