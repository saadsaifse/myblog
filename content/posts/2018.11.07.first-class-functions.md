In programming languages, there is a concept of first class and second class citizens. A first class citizen is one that can be passed as argument, can be returned from a function, can be modified and assigned to a variable. Some first class citizens include, a type, object, entity or value.

In languages such as C, a function is a second class citizen. But JavaSript supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from the other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures and hence are first class citizens.

### Assigning function to variable

```javascript
const hello = function() {
    console.log("hello world");
}

// Invoke it using the variable
hello();
```

### Pass functions as an argument

```javascript
function sayHello() {
    return "Hello, ";
}
function greeting(helloMessage, name) {
    console.log(helloMessage() + name);
}
// Pass `sayHello` as an argument to `greeting` function
greeting(sayHello, "JavaScript!");
```

### Return a function

```javascript
function sayHello() {
    return function() {
        console.log("Hello!");
    }
}
```

A function that returns a function is called Higher-Order Function. Inner function can be invoked as

```javascript
const myFunc = sayHello();
myFunc();
```

or by using double paranthesis as

```javascript
sayHello()();
```
