JavaScript is a weekly typed language, that means it allows writing code that merges values of different types in any way. So we can write something like `"string" + 1` and it will not complain, like in other strongly typed languages such as C# or Java.

What JavaScriptâ€™s just in time compiler does is, it tries to convert values to different types, based on operators and type of operands involved. In above scenario, it converts 1 to `'1'` so it can be appended with string to produce string1 as a result. That implicit type conversion is called type coercion or conversion.

#### Examples

```javascript
console.log(3 * null) //0

console.log("6" - 1) //5

console.log("6" + 1) //61

console.log("five" * 2) //NaN

console.log(false == 0) //true

console.log(null == undefined) //true

console.log(null == 0) //false

console.log(true + false) //1

console.log(21 / "7") //3

console.log("number" + 15 + 3) //number153

console.log(15 + 3 + "number") //18number

console.log([1] > null) //true as > operator triggers [1] to numeric conversion i.e 1 > 0

console.log("foo" + +"bar") //fooNaN as unary operator + has higher precedence "foo" + (+"bar") = "foo" + NaN = fooNaN

console.log("true" == true) //false as == operator triggers numeric conversion so 'true' becomes NaN

console.log(false == "false") //false as == operator turns 'false' to NaN, so false == NaN = false

console.log(null == "") //false as null does not get converted to numeric and null == '' is false

console.log(!!"false" == !!"true") //true

console.log(["x"] == "x") //true

console.log([] + null + 1) //null1

console.log([1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]) //false as arrays are two different instances and == check for object's identity not equality

console.log({} + [] + {} + [1]) //[object Object][object Object]1

console.log(!+[] + [] + ![]) //truefalse

console.log(new Date(0) - 0) //0

console.log(new Date(0) + 0) //Thu Jan 01 1970 03:00:00 GMT+0300 (Standard Time)0
```
