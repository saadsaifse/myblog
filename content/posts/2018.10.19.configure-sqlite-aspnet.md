ASP.Net core is a cross platform framework for developing web applications. By default, it uses SQL Server as its data source. But SQL Server is not yet fully cross platform, so when I moved my existing application that was configured to run with SQL Server, it of course didn’t run. I could not use InMemory database, as it does not fully support relational schemas. So the best alternative is SQLite.

Following are the steps to migrate your ASP.Net Core application from SQL to SQLite.

1. Install SQLite from [this link](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and put the executables in your desired folder.
1. Install Entity Framework Sqlite package using below commands in the project’s directory

    ```cmd
    dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
    dotnet restore
    ```

1. Specify to use SQLite with your data context in Configure Services method.

    ```csharp
    services.AddDbContext(options =>
              options.UseSqlite("Data Source=yourDbName.db"))
    ```
1. Apply EF migrations to the new database. If you already have migrations in your code then skip the first command, else run both.

    ```cmd
    dotnet ef migrations add Initial
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

That’s it. Run your application and verify if it all works. Happy Coding!
